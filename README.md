## A simple website blocker chrom extension

This is a simple extension to block some websites on chrome. User is redirected to a fixed custom page when a blocked website is opened. 
The websites are blocked for a fixed time interval, which is currently 7 PM to 5 PM, i.e., blocked websites only run between 5-7 PM.
Intentionally, there is is no option to configure the extension in chrome, to avoid giving an easy way of working aroudn the extension.
Removing the extension works obvously.
